- 👋 Hi, I’m @hallstrom91. The Real Dragonslayer of the great white Norrland. (white as in snow, not race).
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming and eating cookies. I also like web-development, but my main interest is in the security aspect of developing both frontend and backend.  
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn JavaScript, Node.js and all JS related stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, whatever I can help with! 
- 📫 How to reach me, on GitHub!
